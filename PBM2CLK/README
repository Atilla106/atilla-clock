# PBM2CLK

Converts a .PBM file into a .CLK format, transition file readable by the clock.

## CLK Format

+ 1 Byte: Number of frames
+ 2 Bytes: Total time of the transition
+ Number of Frames * 48 Bytes : all the frames

The 48 Bytes are output as follows:

+ Line per line (48 pixels per line)
+ 6 Bytes per line, each bit read from right to left (e.g: 01100000 will output 2 red pixels at position 5 and 6, indiced from 0)
